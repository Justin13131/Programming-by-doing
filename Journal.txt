hi
I think I've learned a lot of thing in the first class. I wish this class could be useful.

This class I learnd public class void and main. Wow, I love this class. 

I've learned the differences between int, String, and double from Brendan, it's so interesting!
    String is used to define variables
    Int is used to define negative and positive numbers 
    Double is used to define positive numbers and do some other calculations.
